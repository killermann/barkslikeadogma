One of the major goals of this course is to bring everything we're doing here into the real world. To do that, we're going to keep trying to bring the world into this course.

```
Find some examples of SJD in social media, blogs, news, or wherever - as long as it's out in the world. Feel free to ask for help from your networks. Copy the links, take screenshots, or otherwise document what you found.
```

If you're unsure if a particular thing you see is SJD or not, no problem! Note it anyhow. Most of this is unsure, only together can we find some certainty.
