Why are we doing any of this codex stuff? What good are a bunch of dogmatic cookies?

Remember that long list of cognitive biases we talked about in Dot-Com-Munity? And our hope that the awareness and ability to name them will help us [tame them](https://dotcommunity.course.sjmd.space/biases-on-biases-on-biases/naming-and-taming/)?

The idea behind the Codex of SJD Tenets is similar:

**If we can have common language to describe the ways we're seeing dogma showing up, pinpointing exactly what's going on, we can diminish the power that dogma holds over us and our communities** -- that's the hope, anyway.
