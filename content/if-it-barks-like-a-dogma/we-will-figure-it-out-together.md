As a community, we'll work together to sort out the difference between:

**A.** This thing is annoying me personally, is my pet peeve, or I just plain don't like it.

and

**B.** This thing is something we're constructing and celebrating as a social justice movement that is actually a barrier getting in the way of our own goals.

We'll do this by sharing examples of things we find or are struggling with within the community, then following the norms we set in Module 1 (_name don't blame_, _gratitude not attitude_, appreciative inquiry, etc.).

Sometimes we'll likely learn something is **A** that we suspected was **B**, and that's going to be frustrating.

But a lot of times, the thing we're noticing will be both **A** and **B**, and it will feel glorious.
