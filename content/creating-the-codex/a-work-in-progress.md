Our ability to define SJD, to spot it, to name it, the codex -- really, _all of this stuff_ -- is a work in progress. Just like us.

Even as you continue into Modules 3, 4, 5, and 6, it's okay to keep circling back to what we covered here. And what we covered in "Dot-Com-Munity."

In fact, as a stance, we're super pro-circling (not in a dogmatic way). Circle as much as you need. If we're sure about anything, it's that being unsure is a healthy way to be.

In Module 3, we're going to take a step back and look at the bigger picture of where the Tenets of SJD come from, and what allows them to thrive.
