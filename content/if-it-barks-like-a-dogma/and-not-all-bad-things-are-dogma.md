On the flipside of that same coin, there are potentially a lot of bad, unhelpful, or negative things happening in the name of social justice, or within the movement, that _aren't dogmatic._

The "set of beliefs" and "laid down by authorities" parts of the SJD definition come to mind here.

This distinction is important, because the dogma might be tying our hands as a whole, affecting the entire movement, or pushing us in dangerous or harmful directions. And unraveling the dogma, similarly, can create paths for us to do real good. **This is what we're coming together here to do.**

SJMD isn't a space to whinge about people, ideas, or that _one stupid blog post you read that annoyed the piss out of you_.
