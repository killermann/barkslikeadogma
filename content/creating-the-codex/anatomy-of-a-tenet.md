Earlier we said that something being dogmatic doesn't _necessarily_ mean it's bad. As we start to name Tenets of SJD, let's keep this in mind by not _just_ highlighting the bad, but the full picture.

Every SJD Tenet has the following parts:

**What it looks like:** a short description of the action, attitude, or belief

**Where it’s coming from:** the rationale or explanation for why we uphold this as a rule -- with the best intentions in mind.

**Why it’s getting in the way:** despite the intentions, the ways this rule can actually be getting in the way, or accomplishing the opposite of the goals of social justice

**What we might do instead:** actions, attitudes, or beliefs we can recommend instead (plural is good here: more options are inherently less dogmatic)
