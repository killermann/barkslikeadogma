> The social justice dogma is the set of **beliefs**, stances, and acceptable actions laid down by the authorities within the social justice movement that we hold as incontrovertibly true.

The **beliefs** show up in the social justice movement (SJM) as accepted facts, truths, and principles that we learn as we become part of the movement, and work to teach others.
