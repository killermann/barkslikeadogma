Let's start with the definition introduced by sK back in 2017:

> **The social justice dogma** is the set of beliefs, stances, and acceptable actions laid down by the authorities within the social justice movement that we hold as incontrovertibly true.

Because this is a form of jargon, we want to walk through it bit-by-bit, to make _absolutely_ sure that when we all say "Social Justice Dogma," we're saying the same thing.
