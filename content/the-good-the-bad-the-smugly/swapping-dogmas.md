Another risk is that we simply replace the "social justice dogma" with an anti-"social justice dogma" dogma.

That is, we create a different rigid set of rules that we use to penalize people who follow the SJD, and those other "bad people" who aren't as enlightened as we are.

Please no.

Let's be cognizant of this as we talk about different aspects of social justice dogma, and prioritize:

1. **Avoiding "Us" vs. "Them" language**, especially where "Us" = "SJMD people" and "They" = "SJD" people.
2. **Questioning our own beliefs, stances, and actions**, and being open to being questioned by others.

We can even take this one final step further...
