Our ability to define SJD, to spot it, to name it, the codex -- really, _all of this stuff_ -- is a work in progress. Just like us.

Even as you continue into Modules 3, 4, 5, and 6, it's okay to keep circling back to what we covered here. And what we covered in "Dot-Com-Munity."

In fact, as a stance, we're super pro-circling (not in a dogmatic way). [The Module 2 Community](https://community.sjmd.space/c/course/module-2) is here for you whenever something pops into mind.
