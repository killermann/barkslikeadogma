> The social justice dogma is the set of beliefs, stances, and acceptable actions laid down by the **authorities** within the social justice movement that we hold as incontrovertibly true.

The **authorities** part is the trickiest, because within the movement we have a lot of different authorities. But you can think of authorities generally as anyone, or any source (platform, org, publication, etc.), who is writing the rules above that we follow, and enforce amongst ourselves.

Authorities are the “they” when someone says, “They said you shouldn’t say/think/do that.” Authorities as sources show up when people say “I read on [source] that we should now say/think/do this.”
