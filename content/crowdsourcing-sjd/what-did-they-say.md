We're on the edges of our seats. What did the people in your lives tell you when you asked them about SJD?

Copy/pasted quotes, paraphrases, and bullets are all great.

As unfiltered as possible, even if you think something might not _really_ fit the definition of SJD -- we want _their_ perspectives, not yours (right now, at least -- of course we want yours in general).
