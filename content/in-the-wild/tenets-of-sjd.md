Think of the SJD tenets as concrete, discrete examples of social justice dogma. They are the unwritten rules -- at least, until we write about them.

The more you talk about "social justice dogma," the more it can feel like an amorphous, "kinda means everything and therefore doesn't mean anything" phrase. **Tenets help us narrow down exactly what we mean, as miniature representations of the bigger idea.**

As a reminder:

> The social justice dogma is the set of beliefs, stances, and acceptable actions laid down by the authorities within the social justice movement that we hold as incontrovertibly true.


The tenets _are the_ individual beliefs, stances, and acceptable actions.
