We asked you in the beginning of [Module 1](https://dotcommunity.course.sjmd.space/hail-mary/release-valve/) to share what SJD-related thoughts you had on your mind (if you didn't reply, it's not too late: <a href="https://hues.typeform.com/to/YSZund" title="Reply to the form" data-mode="drawer_right" data-submit-close-delay="2" class="typeform-share">here's the form</a>).

Here are some of the themes we saw in your replies:

- {{% icon comment %}} "Toxic call out culture" as a celebrated tactic
- {{% icon comment %}} "Fighting oppression of one group by accepting oppression of another."
- {{% icon comment %}} "Advocat[ing] for justice to be achieved on [a particular person's] own terms" and only their terms
- {{% icon comment %}} "Reacting negatively to differing perspectives being shared without exploring why that person may have that perspective"
