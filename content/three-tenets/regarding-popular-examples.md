In the rest of this Topic, we'll cover 3 popular examples of SJD tenets.

They're by no means the most important tenets, or the most pernicious, or _the most_ anything. They're simply 3 that the majority of the social justice people we've spoken with have noticed, recognized, been able to name, and see lots of examples of in their work and the media.

So they're useful for us now because we're going to draw on them later, throughout the rest of the course.

**Important caveat:** SJD, like any other artifact of culture, isn't absolute or universal. It's relative, local, and dynamic. If _you_ haven't seen these in your social justice work or community, that just means they haven't permeated your culture (yet?), and we'll suggest that you focus on examples _you do notice_ as you continue through the course.
