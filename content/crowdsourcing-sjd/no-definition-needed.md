One of the remarkable things about "social justice dogma" (SJD) is that, while it's not a phrase most people have heard, it immediately evokes a shared understanding in the minds of lots of people.

So, while the definition is really important for us, in this course + community, to have as a shared foundation, you'll likely find that you don't need to share it when you're talking to other people about SJD.

Just saying "social justice dogma" is usually enough.
