> The social justice dogma is the set of beliefs, stances, and **acceptable actions** laid down by the authorities within the social justice movement that we hold as incontrovertibly true.

**Acceptable actions** are the tactics we should use to put our beliefs and stances to work — all the ways we’re supposed to show up, interact with others (both inside and outside of the movement), and advance the cause.
