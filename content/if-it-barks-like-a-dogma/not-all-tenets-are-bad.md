There are a lot of tenets of the SJD that might not be harmful, bad, negative, or getting in our way. This is true of all dogmatic belief systems.

Sometimes the dogma tells you to do a positive thing. **The problem is the inability to question whether or not a tenet is good.**

If we want to achieve the goals of social justice, we need to be able to figure out if the steps we're taking are getting there.
