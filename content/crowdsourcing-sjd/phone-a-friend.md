Now we want you to ask the people in your lives about the SJD _they're_ noticing:

```
Ask friends to tell share examples of social justice dogma they are seeing. If you're on Facebook, an open-ended question will probably work great. Other options: text/call your accountabilabuddy, send an email to a social-justice-related listserv, or create your own short google form and circulate it.
```

Like we said earlier, you probably won't need to give people much context or definition for what you mean by SJD. If they have something to say, they'll say it.

<small><strong>(As you probably guessed, we're going to ask you to share your findings, so give your friends enough time to reply before you move on.)</strong></small>
