One of the things we mentioned earlier, in the [Defining SJD](/defining-social-justice-dogma/) Topic, is that the implicit statement behind every tenet of SJD is "do this, or you're part of the problem."

Behind that is **the idea that some people are bad and some people are good.**

Within SJD, the bad people are the ones who don't follow the tenets, care about what we care about, know what we know, believe what we believe.

Just like it would be easy for us, in our endeavors here, to replace one dogma with another, it would be easy for us to maintain the idea that some people are bad and others are good, and just swap out the traits of who goes where. 

Let's not.

The neat and tidy categories of "good" and "bad" are dogma inducing.

And the idea that "we're good" and others are "bad" -- because we're on the _right side_, or see the _truer truth_ -- is a recipe for smugness.

**Let's leave both at the door.**
