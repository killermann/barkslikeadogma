As we start to recognize more and more tenets of SJD, we can keep track of them in a codex.

This is something we can do collectively, as members of the broad SJMD community. It's also something you can do locally, within your own SJMD community, as you notice tenets showing up in your life.

The benefit here is the ability to pull out the one we need when we need it. For example, when we're talking to someone else about SJD, or trying to highlight a path toward SJ**M**D.
